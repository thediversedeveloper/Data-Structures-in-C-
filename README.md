What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course I was tasked with different data structures, and implementing them. I used C++ for vector sorting, hash tables, linked lists, and binary search trees. For my final project I was told to make a program that outputs courses, and prerequisites for an advising assistance software.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand

I went through each of the different data structures, and their pros and cons to choose a vector sorting list as my final decision. I was able to add strings and construct a vector class to sort through the list of courses and their prerequisites. Data structures are important to understand because they can be implemented for programming basics and help the foundation of a code.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Any roadblocks I encounter I use several different resources including: "Geeks for Geeks" this website can help with implementing different coding basics on each programming language. I was able to understand beginning of a vector string. I also use PaulProgramming on Youtube, where I can view step by step learning and implementation of each structure. I will say I had a lot of roadblocks, this was my third time taking the class, and I learned the most.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The work on this project expanded my way of thinking, I can see now when I talk I define first, and then explain just like in programming. My inline comments have gotten much better, this class taught me how important it is to write in line comments due to the variety of your program.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Obviously inline comments are a huge evolvement for me in writing programs, but my work has become more readable with the way I line up my program. I would just hit enter wherever it went on the next line was fine, I made sure to have a better tab structure with my in line comments to create easier readability. I learned how important it was to have complete understanding to make better comments, and algorithms instead of just writing the programming.
